FRC 2013 Ultimate Ascent Final Code

This is the code we used in the Israel Regional Competition and in the Off-Season Competiton, Ultimate Ascent FRC 2013.

This code is called "RPM 4590", because we used 4590, our team number, as our RPM for the full court shooter.

This code brought us to the semi-finals!!!
